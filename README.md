## Dublin Core & Omeka 
* Dublin Core is a meta-data schema (set of terms) used as a common set of descriptors for the presentation of online resources (digital and material).
* Omeka uses the Dublin Core meta-data schema in order to help organize, describe, and document the content of your Omeka projects.
* Omeka provides a short description of how you can effectively use the Dublin Core Schema - [Working with Dublin Core - Omeka](http://omeka.org/codex/Working_with_Dublin_Core}

## Omeka Organizational Schema
* The most important thing to understand about Omeka is the organizational hierarchy for content that Omeka operates from.
* There are three basic hierarchies for organizing your content within Omeka, with each building on or pulling from the each other depending on your organizational criteria, etc.:

  2. Collections
