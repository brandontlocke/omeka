## Omeka Overview
* Omeka is a web-publishing platform for the online display and curation of visual collections and exhibitions.
* Great tool for projects utilizing visual images, physical objects, and material culture items.
* Some of the most importatn Omeka featues include: standards-based metadata and web design, data migration tools, exhibit building, curation and organization of material culture items/collections/exhibits, tagging features, and timeline and Google Maps plugins.

## Dublin Core & Omeka 
* Dublin Core is a meta-data schema (set of terms) used as a common set of descriptors for the presentation of online resources (digital and material).
* Omeka uses the Dublin Core meta-data schema in order to help organize, describe, and document the content of your Omeka projects.
* Omeka provides a short description of how you can effectively work with the Dublin Core Schema - [Working with Dublin Core](http://omeka.org/codex/Working_with_Dublin_Core)

## Omeka Organizational Schema
* The most important thing to understand about Omeka is the organizational hierarchy for content that Omeka operates from.
* There are three basic hierarchies for organizing your content within Omeka, with each building on or pulling from the each other depending on your organizational criteria.
* IMPORTANT NOTE - The Exhibit feature has to be added with a plugin (it is easy - just follow the steps in the documentation sheet below at #3 of this section).
* Below are some brief descriptions of these organizational groups:
