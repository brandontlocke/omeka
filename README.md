## Omeka Overview
* Omeka is a web-publishing platform for the online display and curation of visual collections and exhibitions.
* Great tool for projects utilizing visual images, physical objects, and material culture items.
* Some of the most importatn Omeka featues include: standards-based metadata and web design, data migration tools, exhibit building, curation and organization of material culture items/collections/exhibits, tagging features, and timeline and Google Maps plugins.
* Good overview video for Omeka here - [Omeka Documentation, 2.0 Overview (Video)](https://vimeo.com/55973380)


## Registering & Managing Users
* There is no batch add for users.
* You will need to add each individual user one by one.
* Once added, Omeka is supposed to send each individual user a registration email with steps for getting their account set-up completed; however, this doesn't always seem to happen.
* As a workaround, you will need to register each user with a personalized username (I use their MSU Net ID) and a general password (I use 112oldhort).
* The first thing that students will need to do when they meet with you for the first time is to change their general password to a personalized one (they can do this by going to the Edit User button and then clicking on Change Password).

## Dublin Core & Omeka 
* Dublin Core is a meta-data schema (set of terms) used as a common set of descriptors for the presentation of online resources (digital and material).
* Omeka uses the Dublin Core meta-data schema in order to help organize, describe, and document the content of your Omeka projects.
* Omeka provides a short description of how you can effectively work with the Dublin Core Schema - [Omeka Documentation, Working with Dublin Core](http://omeka.org/codex/Working_with_Dublin_Core)

## Omeka Organizational Schema
* The most important thing to understand about Omeka is the organizational hierarchy for content that Omeka operates from.
* There are three basic hierarchical groupings for organizing your content within Omeka - Items, Collections, and Exhibits. Each of these builds on or pulls from each other depending on your organizational criteria.
* Items are the individual pieces in your collection.
* Collections are groups of items that have some common trait (theme, time period, artist, etc) that is important for the organization of your project.
* Exhibits are essentially the entire project that you are presenting (made up of individual Items that are grouped into Collection).
* IMPORTANT NOTE - The Exhibit feature has to be added with a plugin (it is easy - just follow the steps in the documentation sheet below at #3 of this section).
* Below are some brief descriptions of these organizational groups:
